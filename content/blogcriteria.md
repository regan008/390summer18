Throughout the semester you will write a total of **6** blog posts. Each blog post will build on a topic discussed in class and they will often build on our in class tool tutorials. Blog posts will be due the following Sunday by 9:00am.

Your blog posts should be at least 350-500 words and should be written in a semi-formal scholarly style (complete thoughts, correct spelling, grammar and syntax.) Please use the Chicago style guide to cite any sources. Each blog post is worth a total of 3 points.

### Grading Rubric
**3 points (full credit)**: A post that receives full credit will be focused, organized, and coherently answer the prompt. The post engages with the readings for the week and any in class activities. Relevant images, charts, or sources are embedded within the post and the post is written in a semi-formal academic style. The author illustrates in-depth engagement with the topic.

**1.5 points**: The blog post mostly answers or follows the prompt and it includes mostly descriptions, summaries, or short answers. The post doesn't support claims with proper evidence, thoughtful analysis, or relevant examples. The most may contain incomplete sentences, thoughts, or paragraphs but attempts to answer the prompt. The post may fall short of the required 350-500 word length.

**No Credit**: The blog post is either incomplete or shows no evidence of engagement with the topic.
