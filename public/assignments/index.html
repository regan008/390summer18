<h3 id="quizzes-10">Quizzes (10%):</h3>

<p>This course will include readings related to both the history of the Progressive Era and to Digital History. You should come to class prepared to discuss the readings listed on the syllabus for that day. On any day I may give a short quiz on the readings.</p>

<h3 id="participation-10">Participation (10%):</h3>

<p>This is an abbreviated summer class making attendance even more crucial to your success. We&rsquo;ll cover 16 weeks of history and technology skills in just 8 weeks which means missing class will put you at a severe disadvantage. Our assignments will build on the exercises and demonstrations done in class and students who are not present will have difficulty keeping up. At the end of class I will pass around a sign in sheet to keep track of attendance.</p>

<p>While class participation necessitates you attend class, it is not defined solely by attendance. I expect that students will come to class having done the readings beforehand. Students should be ready to discuss the readings, exchange ideas, and actively participate in class discussions. Grades will be determined by not just your presence in class but also by your contribution to class discussions and activities.</p>

<h3 id="midterm-20">Midterm (20%)</h3>

<p>There will be an in-class midterm on Monday, July 2.</p>

<h3 id="blog-posts-20">Blog Posts (20%):</h3>

<p>For each assignment you will write a well argued blog post of approximately 500 words. Each post should be written in a semi-formal manner with correct prose that includes full sentences, paragraphs, and topic sentences. Be sure to respond fully to the prompt but do not simply list answers to all the questions. Thoughtful posts will receive full credit (3pts), others will receive partial(1.5pts) or no credit.</p>

<h3 id="mini-skills-projects-8-5-each-40">Mini Skills Projects (8 @ 5% each = 40%):</h3>

<p>Throughout the course we will learn to use a series of digital tools and methodologies to ask and answer historical questions. The results of each small project will be embedded on your blog. The 9 projects are: (1) metadata in Omeka, (2) exhibits and digital storytelling in Omeka, (3) a database, (4) mapping, (5) text mining, (6) visualizations, (7) a timeline, (8) a reflection and portfolio of your work throughout the class. Further details for each are available on the course schedule.</p>
